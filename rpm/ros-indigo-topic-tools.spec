%description
Tools for directing, throttling, selecting, and otherwise messing with ROS
topics at a meta level. None of the programs in this package actually know about
the topics whose streams they are altering; instead, these tools deal with
messages as generic binary blobs. This means they can be applied to any ROS
topic.

# in the install tree that was dropped by catkin, and source it.  It will
# set things like CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, PKG_CONFIG_PATH, and PYTHONPATH.
