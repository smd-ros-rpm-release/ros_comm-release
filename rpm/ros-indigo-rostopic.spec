%description
rostopic contains the rostopic command-line tool for displaying debug
information about ROS Topics, including publishers, subscribers, publishing
rate, and ROS Messages. It also contains an experimental Python library for
getting information about and interacting with topics dynamically. This library
is for internal-use only as the code API may change, though it does provide
examples of how to implement dynamic subscription and publication behaviors in
ROS.
